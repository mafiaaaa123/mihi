              WHAT IS LECENSING?

       There has always been a lot of confusion in what licensing really means. When one licenses something, one is not giving its rights away, as the copyrights (or the patent, if one has one) are your own to have. Licenses provide rules and guidelines for others to use your work.
Different types of open source licenses: 
    • BSD License
    • APACHE LICENSE
    • GNU  GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

      HISTORY  OF LICENSES:-
              BSD License:- the BSD licence can claim to be the oldest of the open source licences. In fact its long life has resulted in there being more than one version, and it is slightly misleading to speak of the BSD licence as a result. Although the history of its evolution is an interesting one, for the purposes of this document we will confine ourselves to detailing the last major revision that resulted in what is today called the modified BSD licence or the new BSD licence. 
       
    •  APACHE LICENSE :-Beginning in 1995, the Apache Group (later the Apache Software Foundation) released successive versions of their well-known httpd server. Their initial licence was essentially the same as the old BSD licence, with only the names of the organisations changed.
    • GNU  GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE:The History of the GPL. The GPL (The GNU General Public License), created by Richard Stallman, serves as the de facto constitution for the Free Software movement. ... In the early years (1984 to 1988), the GNU Project did not have a single license to cover all its software.

*IDEA OF LICENSING :-
1.BSD LICENSE:-BSD licenses are a family of permissive free software licenses, imposing minimal restrictions on the use and distribution of covered software. ... The original BSD license was used for its namesake, the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), a Unix-like operating system.

2.APACHE LICENSE:-The Apache License is a free and open source software (FOSS) licensing agreement from the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). The agreement stipulates terms for use, reproduction, modification and distribution of any software that is released under the Apache License.

3.GNU LICENSE:- The GNU General Public License, often shortened to GNU GPL (or simply GPL), lists terms and conditions for copying, modifying and distributing free software. The GPL was created by Richard Stallman in order to protect GNU software from being made proprietary. It is a specific implementation of his "copyleft" concept.
     
      WHTAT ALL PROBLEMS DID THE LICENSES SOLVED?
1. Yes. You can use BSD-licensed projects in closed-source, commercial projects. ... From WikiPedia's BSD License page: The BSD License allows proprietary use and allows the software released under the license to be incorporated into proprietary products.
2.The source code of Apache is available for free to anyone and no license is required. It can be modified to adjust the code and also to fix errors. The ability to add more features and modules makes it a favorite among the techies.
3.GPL Advantages and Disadvantages. A common reason to use the GPL is when modifying or extending the gcc compiler. ... For those who must work with statically-linked implementations of multiple software standards, the GPL is often a poor license, because it precludes using proprietary implementations of the standards.
                        *Licensing model?
* BSD LICENSE: 1. Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.
2. Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.
3. Neither the name of the copyright holder nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.
*2.Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any contributions submitted by a licensee to a licensor will be under the terms of the license without any terms and conditions, but this does not preclude any separate agreements with the licensor regarding these contributions. 
Apache license version 2.0 makes sure that the user does not have to worry about infringing any patents by using the software. The user is granted a license to any patent that covers the software. This license is terminated if the user sues anyone over patent infringement related to this software. This condition is added in order to prevent patent litigations. 
*3.Software under the GPL may be run for all purposes, including commercial purposes and even as a tool for creating proprietary software, for example when using GPL-licensed compilers.[49] Users or companies who distribute GPL-licensed
